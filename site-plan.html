      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I have been designing and building gaming appliances for the last 6 years, and I am ready to share with everyone who wants what I got.
        My website will be the all-new means of selling my gaming software. I’ve been making and selling keyboards, controllers, headsets, monitors, mouses, almost anything you can think of, I have. I only sell the highest quality with the lowest prices.
        My company designs using futuristic themes for all items, builds using the newest technology, and USED to sell via websites like amazon and eBay. But now we are taking things into our own hands, with our new website!
        On this website you will be able to see what things like our new items, company policy, contact information, customer support, and a shopping ability which allows you to buy whatever you want on our website, and will be delivered right to your door using UPS and USPS.

But now with my brand-new way of advertising. I will have Demos of all my products being used in short videos, comparing these with brand name items. I do this so that You can know for certain what you are buying.
